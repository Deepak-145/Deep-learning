## Problem Statement
Predict whether a customer will churn or not.

## Dataset
The dataset was imbalanced and no resampling techniques were applied.

## Model Architecture
- Input Layer
- Hidden Layers (ReLU)
- Output Layer (Sigmoid)

## Results
Accuracy: 86%

Note:
The model was trained on imbalanced data without applying techniques 
like SMOTE or class weighting.
